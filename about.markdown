My name is David.  Sometimes I do computer stuff:
 * low-latency systems
 * distributed computing (NB: CAP more than docker-compose)
 * numerical analysis, scientific computing
 * application/system behavior analysis (previously known as performance engineering)

I'm not really a public person.  Please figure out how to talk with me if you want to talk with me.
